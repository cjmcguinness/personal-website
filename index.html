            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a software developer and qualified European and Chartered Patent Attorney specializing in software inventions.</p>
            <p>I bring a unique combination of technical and legal insight to software development, and I am looking to contribute this unique mix of skills to an interesting product and development team.</p> 
            <p>Throughout my legal career, I have honed exceptional analytical and communication skills. Attorney work involves quickly and efficiently digesting complex concepts to understand a wide range of technologies, then communicating this understanding in oral and written form to both clients and patent offices worldwide to secure commercially valuable patent protection. </p>
            <p>Training as a software developer I have completed a number of projects (listed and linked below) and completed online courses and read software development books.</p>

                    <li>The backend, written in Rust, processes selected areas and generates hillshade or SVG contour plots which are then returned to the front end.</li>
                    <li>Utilized AWS's Open Data Registry to source the geospatial data required for generating the maps.</li>
