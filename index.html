            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a software developer and qualified European and Chartered Patent Attorney specializing in software inventions with a physics degree from the University of Oxford. I bring a unique combination of legal expertise and technical insight to software development. I have learned to code in my free time, building a solid foundation through personal projects, online courses, and reading.</p>
            <p>Throughout my legal career, I have gained exceptional analytical and communication skills. Attorney work involves quickly and efficiently digesting complex concepts to understand a wide range of technologies, then communicating this understanding in oral and written form to both clients and patent offices worldwide to secure commercially valuable patent protection.</p> 
            <p>Around half of my legal practice involves providing legal services for startup clients, such as: a biochemical computing startup; a quantum algorithms startup; and, an electric vehicle startup. The most enjoyable part of the work is solving complex technical and legal problems, and managing diverse, high-stakes tasks with tight, immovable deadlines. These skills will be invaluable in a startup environment. Given my skill set, I can add value as a software developer, scientist, and legal advisor.</p>
